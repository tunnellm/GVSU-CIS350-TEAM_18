# Overview

> The purpose of this document is to present a detailed account of the features and test cases for the Android application, ColCalendar18. This document explains the purpose and features of the calendar, the interfaces thereof, what the calendar will do, and the constaints under which it must operate. Furthermore, this document details how the calendar will react to external stimuli such as End-User input. This document further details the test cases by which the application has been rigorously tested on. This document is intended for all stakeholders of the calendar. Stakeholders include, but are not limited to, the investors, the developers, and the quality assurance testing team. This document and application are to be proposed to mrdoktorprofessor and the 1-PM Morning class of CIS350 for their approval and a received grade of an A.

# Software Requirements

> The following section describes all of the requirements for ColCalendar18 as well as which Test Cases are linked to each requirement. There is a Functional Requirements sub-section that lists all of the functional requirements and relevant test cases for the application. Following is a Non-Functional Requirements sub-section that lists all of the non-functional requirements and the relevant test cases for the application. All of the requirements for both sub-sections are listed with a high-level description of their use-cases.
